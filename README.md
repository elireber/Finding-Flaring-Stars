# Finding-Flaring-Stars

This project was for my engineering senior design class, in which we were given light curves from the NASA Keplar Telescope and has to work on identifying solar flares in the data.  I was responsible for bulidng a noise-reducing algorithm that would get rid of the excess noise in the data and leave a clearer image of the actual signal itself.  At the end, of the filtering procedure it can be seen that the light curve contains a much smaller range of Y values, as well as a more clearly defined solar flare signal.

### Folder Contents:
